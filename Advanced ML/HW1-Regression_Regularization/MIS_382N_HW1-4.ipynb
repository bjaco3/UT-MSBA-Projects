        "\n",
        "1. ML Ops is the process and infrastructure that is built up around projects that use machine learning to ensure that the projects are able to perform optimally on a continuous basis. Creating models and algorithms to make decisions is only one piece of a successful business operation. To succeed on an ongoing basis you must also take into account: data collection, data validation, model monitoring, software infrastructure, communication of results, and many other things. MLOps helps to address several potential real-world challenges: the  necessary maintenance and updating of models and infrastructure, communication between the technical team that is building models and the business team focusing on outcomes, and evaluating risk of model errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. There are 7 major phases of MLOps. The first phase revolves around defining the businesses goals or problem that must be solved. It is often desirable and appropriate to define performance metrics here that will facilitate evaluation of the project. Proper framing and  objective setting in this step is vital because it will influence all other steps in the process. The next major phase of MLOps is to begin searching for the inputs that will be used to feed your models. This involves exploring potentially relevant data sets to assess their feasibility. Additionally, data evaluation should take into account the data's regulatory compliance, accessibility, and credibility. At this step, you will also need to consider how many sources are going to be used and the feasibility of building pipelines to optimize the model once it is in production.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Now that the big picture is taken care of, the next phase entails diving into the weeds with data preparation and processing. Data prep is needed to handle the typical data wrangling tasks of: feature engineering, outlier removal, proper formatting, feature selection, and anything else necessary to put the data into model-ready form. After the data has been processed, the next phase is where the data science comes in. You need to design the best model possible that can fulfill the business objectives given the data that has been processed in step 3. The output of this step should be a model or models that have been fully validated and tested.\n",
        "\n",
        "   With the model built, the next few steps are designed to handle the many tasks involved in implementing  the model. Step 5 is building and automating ML pipelines. You will need training and testing pipelines, with the capability for auditing the pipeline runs and validating data that comes in. After the pipelines are built, you can move onto deployment which could involve a static deployment where a model is packaged into application software before distribution or dynamic deployment where the model will be accessed through a web based API. With the model deployed, the final phase requires model monitoring and optimization. Systems will need to be put into place to track the performance of the model and watch for system failures. As time passes, the model will need to be updated or altered so continual maintenance will be necessary."

        "The type of machine learning problem Facebook is solving here is a regression problem. They are trying to predict what the chance is that you know another Facebook user. Facebook would likely use any information it can get its hands on to answer this question. Possible examples are: mutual friends, location, activities, interests, ideological views, schooling, work, clubs, sports, age, family, purchasing patterns, and just about anything else could be useful! I believe the ethical implications of the output are quite harmless because anyone can simply ignore the recommendation and the notification itself is unlikely to stir up any trouble. The potential for ethical issues to come into play here would primarily revolve around the vast amounts of information Facebook acquires around an individual in the process of making the recommendation. This implementation may be harmless, but its possible someone could cause harm with the information generated in this process.\n"

        "\n",
        "1. Simpson's paradox is a phenomenon that occurs when data reveals a certain trend that is reversed or nonexistent when the data is split into groups based on another variable. This can happen when variables of interest are systemically higher or lower in one group than the other. In addition to identifying \"lurking variables\" that group the observations, in many cases it is important to normalize the data to represent rates as opposed to raw counts. Simpson's paradox highlights the importance of being skeptical when observing results from a single data viewpoint. \n",

        "From 2000-2013, the median US wage had risen about 1% (adjusted for inflation), however, the median wages for every educational subgroup had decreased.  The reason for the paradox is due to the changes in proportions of the educational subgroups over the 13 years. In 2013, there were many more college graduates than 2000, but their wages had fallen at a much slower rate (1.2%) than those of workers with less education (7.9%). The increase in the proportion of college graduates overpowered the decline in wages for specific groups.\n",

Then scale the data (not including target) so that each of the independent variables would have zero mean and unit variance.

For the sweep of the regularization parameter, we will look at a grid of values ranging from α=10^10 to α=10^−6.

        "\n",
        "The primary benefit of ridge, lasso, and elastic net are that each technique helps to reduce the variance of the model by reducing overfitting and can also help to reduce the model complexity. Ridge regression will reduce the absolute magnitude of the regression coefficients, but the main drawback is that it will not eliminate any coefficients, simply reduce their impact. In contrast, the penalty term utlized in lasso regression will perform feature selection by eliminating certain variables entirely. There are a few cons associated with using lasso regularization such as lasso's difficulty in data sets with a large number of features relative to samples. Also, in data sets with highly correlated features, lasso will simply select one and ignore the others. The elastic net overcomes these limitations. It is essentially a synthesis of both the ridge and lasso methods."
